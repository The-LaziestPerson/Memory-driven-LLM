By hypotheses 1 and 2 the repulsive energy between any two electron domains increases as their separation decreases, so the minimum-energy arrangement is the one that maximizes the smallest interior angle θ between any pair of domains.  Hypothesis 4 states that for each n VSEPR gives a unique regular polyhedron; the angle θ is therefore a function only of n.  For the regular polyhedra involved:  \n- n = 2 → linear, θ = 180°  \n- n = 3 → trigonal planar, θ = 120°  \n- n = 4 → tetrahedral, θ = arccos(–1/3) ≈ 109.47°  \n- n = 5 → trigonal-bipyramidal, θ = 90° (and 120°)  \n- n = 6 → octahedral, θ = 90°  \n\nThus the minimum interior angle θ_min(n) between any two electron domains is fixed by the geometry that maximizes separation for the given n.  Removing the constraint that θ must equal these specific values would allow smaller angles and hence higher Coulomb energy, contradicting hypothesis 3.  The new variable is therefore the exact numerical value θ_min(n) dictated by the regular polyhedron assigned by VSEPR for each n.\n\nNew hypothesis  \nThe minimum interior angle θ_min between any two valence-shell electron domains around a central atom is the characteristic angle of the regular VSEPR polyhedron prescribed for the integer number n of electron domains.\n\nVerification check  \nθ_min is dimensionless (degrees or radians), consistent with the dimensionless count n; no units violation occurs.\n\nConclusion  \nThis single-step variable definition quantifies the angular separation demanded by the combined Coulomb and Pauli", "rejected": "The minimum interior angle θ_min between any two valence-shell electron domains around a central atom is always exactly 90° regardless of the integer number n of electron domains, ensuring the molecule’s energy equals n times the rest-mass energy of a single electron expressed in joules per mole per degree."}

Because ATP hydrolysis (prior hypothesis 1) powers transcription, translation, and post-translational modification, the steady-state concentration of any specialist protein P_s is strictly bounded by the mass-specific ATP supply rate σ_ATP (mol ATP cell⁻¹ s⁻¹) and the stoichiometric cost n (mol ATP per mol P_s synthesized and maintained).  Dimensionally, [P_s] = σ_ATP / n, so the maximal proteomic fraction ϕ_s devoted to the specialist function equals (σ_ATP M_s)/(n ρ_cell), where M_s is the molar mass of P_s and ρ_cell is cell mass density.

Writing the general equilibrium expression K = Π(products)^ν / Π(reactants)^ν, the product of the final concentration ratios equals the original K.  Introduce the single new variable ξ, the extent of reaction (in mol) that proceeds after the perturbation; every stoichiometric coefficient ν_i converts concentration change to ξ via Δ[V] = νξ/V.  Substitute these changes into the equilibrium expression, set the resulting quotient equal to the original K, and solve for ξ; the resulting equation is a polynomial in ξ whose sole positive root gives exactly the shift needed to restore Q = K.  Thus the extent of reaction ξ is uniquely determined by the requirement that the re-written concentration ratios reproduce the fixed K.  \n\nDimensional check: K and Q are dimensionless; ξ carries units mol, and each concentration term is converted by division by volume V, so the argument of every power remains mol L⁻¹, preserving dimensionless quotients.  \n\nNew hypothesis (single declarative sentence):  \nThe extent of reaction ξ that occurs after a concentration perturbation is the unique positive root of the polynomial obtained by inserting the concentration changes Δ[V] = νξ/V into the equilibrium expression and equating the resulting quotient to the fixed equilibrium constant K.", "rejected": "The extent of reaction ξ is always exactly twice the unique positive root of the polynomial obtained by inserting the concentration changes Δ[V] = νξ²/V into the equilibrium expression and equating the resulting quotient to the fixed equilibrium constant K."}

The Calvin cycle uses this ATP (and NADPH) to fix CO₂ into carbohydrates, sequestering the original light energy in C–C and C–H bond enthalpy.\n\nDerivation of the new hypothesis  \nBecause every ATP comes from 3 H⁺, the total luminal proton flux Φ_H (mol H⁺ m⁻² s⁻¹) sets an upper bound on ATP production rate J_ATP (mol ATP m⁻² s⁻¹).  Dimensionally, J_ATP = Φ_H / 3.  Φ_H itself is driven by the absorbed photon flux I (mol photons m⁻² s⁻¹) through the linear electron-transport chain that pumps one proton per photon (Z-scheme stoichiometry).  Hence Φ_H = I, giving J_ATP = I / 3.  Carbohydrate fixation requires 3 ATP per CO₂, so the CO₂ assimilation rate A (mol CO₂ m⁻² s⁻¹) equals J_ATP / 3.  Substituting J_ATP = I / 3 yields A = I / 9.  This single-step proportionality is a direct algebraic consequence of the prior hypotheses and conserves units: [I] = mol photons m⁻² s⁻¹ and [A] = mol CO₂ m⁻² s⁻¹.\n\nNew hypothesis  \nCO₂ assimilation rate A equals one-ninth of the absorbed photon flux I.", "rejected": "The Calvin cycle’s CO₂ assimilation rate A (mol CO₂ m⁻² s⁻¹) equals the absorbed photon flux I (mol photons m⁻² s⁻¹) multiplied by the sacred number 7, giving A = 7I."}

Neutral mutations therefore accumulate at a rate set by the mutation–drift balance.\n\nHow they relate  \nBecause 64 codons map to 21 meanings (20 amino acids + stop), the code is degenerate: several codons encode the same amino acid.  Prior hypothesis 3 states that any mutation converting one such synonymous codon to another is phenotypically neutral; prior hypothesis 4 states that these neutral mutations accumulate at the neutral rate μ (mutations per site per generation) multiplied by the effective population size Ne and drift balance.  Hence, within any protein-coding gene the number of synonymous sites Lsyn is a subset of the total coding sites Ltot, and only these sites can accept mutations without immediate selective cost.\n\nDerivation of the new variable  \nLet ksyn be the observed number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site between two aligned sequences.  By definition, ksyn = Ssyn/Lsyn, where Ssyn is the count of observed synonymous differences.  From the prior hypotheses, every such difference is neutral, so its expectation over evolutionary time t (in generations) is E[ksyn] = μt.  Rearranging gives the constraint Lsyn = Ssyn/ksyn.  Because Ssyn and ksyn are measurable quantities, Lsyn is operationally defined through them.\n\nVerification  \nUnits: Ssyn is dimensionless (count), ksyn is dimensionless (substitutions per site), so Lsyn is dimensionless (number of sites), satisfying dimensional consistency.\n\nNew hypothesis (single declarative sentence)  \nThe number of synonymous sites Lsyn in a protein-coding gene equals the observed count of synonymous differences Ssyn divided by the observed synonymous divergence ksyn.", "rejected": "The number of synonymous sites Lsyn equals the observed count of synonymous differences Ssyn multiplied by the observed synonymous divergence ksyn and the speed of light c, so Lsyn = Ssyn·ksyn·c."}

Thus the definition H = U + PV together with the first law rigorously forces the enthalpy difference between any two fixed-pressure states to equal the heat exchanged at that pressure; no other heat term is possible.  Hence the heat of reaction at constant pressure is identical to the enthalpy difference between products and reactants.\n\nNew hypothesis (single declarative sentence)  \nThe heat of reaction at constant pressure equals the enthalpy difference between products and reactants, q_p = H_products – H_reactants.", "rejected": "The heat of reaction at constant pressure equals the enthalpy difference multiplied by temperature, q_p = T(H_products – H_reactants)."}
