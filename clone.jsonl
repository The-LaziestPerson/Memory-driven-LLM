A unit pH change compresses a 10-fold multiplicative change in hydrogen-ion activity.\n\nDerivation of the new hypothesis  \nBecause pH is a logarithmic transform of activity, the perceptual “distance” between two solutions is not the numerical pH difference ΔpH but the dimensionless activity ratio R = a_H⁺,₂ / a_H⁺,₁.  From the definition pH₁ = –log₁₀ a_H⁺,₁ and pH₂ = –log₁₀ a_H⁺,₂, subtraction gives  \nΔpH = pH₂ – pH₁ = –log₁₀(a_H⁺,₂ / a_H⁺,₁) = –log₁₀ R.  \nSolving for R yields  \nR = 10^(–ΔpH).  \nThus the activity ratio required to produce any stated perceptual pH shift is fixed entirely by the single variable ΔpH.\n\nNew hypothesis (single declarative sentence)  \nThe hydrogen-ion activity ratio between two aqueous samples equals 10 raised to the negative of their pH difference, R = 10^(–ΔpH).", "rejected": "The perceived acidity ratio between two solutions equals the simple numerical pH difference itself, R = ΔpH.", "E_acc": 0.5263380408287048, "C_acc": 0.22940750420093536, "G_acc": 0.5764767419546842, "D_acc": 0.7098971588004913, "H_acc": 0.11900639533996582, "Q_acc": 0.657394052025463, "E_rej": 0.18209995329380035, "C_rej": 0.5161654949188232, "G_rej": 0.5628419568296522, "D_rej": 0.7824215888977051, "H_rej": 0.21757841110229492, "Q_rej": 0.4986917550396175, "Delta_Q": 0.15870229698584548, "flag_reject": false, "flag_low_reasoning": false, "flag_hallucination": false}

Fertilization restores the diploid number by fusing two haploid gametes, thereby combining genomes from two parents.\n\nRelation among prior hypotheses  \nHypotheses 2 and 3 are the two stochastic mechanisms that operate during meiosis; their combined effect is to generate combinatorial diversity among the haploid products (hypothesis 1).  Hypothesis 4 then fuses two of these diverse haploid sets, so the variation created in 2 and 3 is finally packaged into diploid offspring.\n\nDerivation of the new hypothesis  \nLet n be the haploid chromosome number (a positive integer).  Each bivalent can be oriented in two ways at metaphase I, so independent assortment alone yields 2^n distinct chromosome combinations per gamete (hypothesis 3).  Crossing-over (hypothesis 2) can, in principle, place any of the ~2·(l/c) non-overlapping 1-centimorgan (cM) intervals along a chromosome into a new allelic state, where l is the total genetic length of the genome in cM and c = 1 cM.  For each interval the probability of an odd number of crossovers (hence a detectable reassortment of alleles) is ½ under the standard Poisson model of recombination.  The expected number of such reassorting intervals is therefore l/2.  Consequently the total number of distinct haploid types that can be produced is 2^n · 2^(l/2) = 2^(n + l/2).  Because fertilization (hypothesis 4) combines two independent gametes, the number of genetically distinct diploid zygotes that can be formed from a single meiosis-to-fertilization cycle is the square of this quantity, 2^(2n + l).\n\nNew variable introduced  \nV = 2^(2n + l) is the maximum number of genetically distinct diploid offspring genotypes that can be generated from one pair of parents whose gametes are produced by standard meiosis and random fertilization.\n\nConstraint check  \nn and l are dimensionless counts (chromosomes and", "rejected": "The number of genetically unique diploid offspring one parental pair can produce by meiosis and fertilization is exactly 2^n where n is the haploid chromosome number, because crossing-over is negligible and all loci on a chromosome always stay perfectly linked.", "E_acc": 0.40504831075668335, "C_acc": 0.20404818654060364, "G_acc": 0.6604113052599132, "D_acc": 0.6873980772991976, "H_acc": 0.06336131691932678, "Q_acc": 0.6439306007387737, "E_rej": 0.0013073072768747807, "C_rej": 0.9815752506256104, "G_rej": 0.6607298206072301, "D_rej": 0.864857405424118, "H_rej": 0.16892824321985245, "Q_rej": 0.39230176294222474, "Delta_Q": 0.251628837796549, "flag_reject": true, "flag_low_reasoning": false, "flag_hallucination": false}

Electrons are charged particles whose mutual Coulomb repulsion increases with decreasing separation.  \n2. The Pauli exclusion principle requires that no two electrons in a molecule may share the same quantum state.  \n3. These repulsive and quantum constraints compel the valence electron pairs around a central atom to occupy positions that maximize their average separation.  \n4. VSEPR theory identifies these positions as the vertices of a regular polyhedron whose geometry—linear, trigonal planar, tetrahedral, etc.—is determined solely by the integer number of electron domains.\n\nDerivation of the new hypothesis  \nLet n be the integer number of valence-shell electron domains (lone pairs or bonding pairs) on a central atom.  By hypotheses 1 and 2 the repulsive energy between any two electron domains increases as their separation decreases, so the minimum-energy arrangement is the one that maximizes the smallest interior angle θ between any pair of domains.  Hypothesis 4 states that for each n VSEPR gives a unique regular polyhedron; the angle θ is therefore a function only of n.  For the regular polyhedra involved:  \n- n = 2 → linear, θ = 180°  \n- n = 3 → trigonal planar, θ = 120°  \n- n = 4 → tetrahedral, θ = arccos(–1/3) ≈ 109.47°  \n- n = 5 → trigonal-bipyramidal, θ = 90° (and 120°)  \n- n = 6 → octahedral, θ = 90°  \n\nThus the minimum interior angle θ_min(n) between any two electron domains is fixed by the geometry that maximizes separation for the given n.  Removing the constraint that θ must equal these specific values would allow smaller angles and hence higher Coulomb energy, contradicting hypothesis 3.

Both are sample averages over n i.i.d. observations, but p̃_t uses importance weights w_i = P(x_i)/Q(x_i) to correct for sampling from a biased proposal Q. To compare their variances, we examine the second moments. For p̂_t, the variance is Var[p̂_t] = (1/n) p_t (1 - p_t). For p̃_t, the variance is Var[p̃_t] = (1/n) Var_Q[w · 𝟙{X > t}], where the expectation is under Q. Expanding this: Var_Q[w · 𝟙{X > t}] = E_Q[(w · 𝟙{X > t})^2] - (E_Q[w · 𝟙{X > t}])^2. The second term is p_t^2 since E_Q[w · 𝟙{X > t}] = p_t. The first term is E_Q[w^2 · 𝟙{X > t}] = E_P[w · 𝟙{X > t}] = E_P[w | X > t] · p_t. Thus, Var[p̃_t] = (1/n) (E_P[w | X > t] · p_t - p_t^2) = (1/n) p_t (E_P[w | X > t] - p_t). The variance reduction condition Var[p̃_t] < Var[p̂_t] simplifies to E_P[w | X > t] < 1.
